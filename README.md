#C++ Exercises

This repository is just some exercises to practice C++ coding standards, best practices and new 
features from a not so newbie on POO PoV but for someone that does not program in this language 
since a long time (probably C++98) 

This repository is intended to keep track of my learning and improve my knowledge of the language with 
the help of anyone that has anything to say ;)
